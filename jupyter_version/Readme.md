I recommend using PythonIDE (Pycharm) because it allows you to execute in terminal and is more efficient in many ways.

But if you still want to use Jupyter notebook, in fact they are convertible. You just need to replace the "main" part with regular plain codes and do not use "args parse" since it's a command line tool and will give errors if you use it in the Jupyter notebook.
